Hi there! My name is Shishir Subedi and I am a security engineer currently working for a company where I am responsible for maintaining the security of our cloud infrastructure. In my role, I have the opportunity to work with various modern technologies such as Docker ,Kubernetes, which I find extremely interesting and challenging.

In addition to my work responsibilities, I am also deeply passionate about offensive side of cyber security and have a particular interest in web application security, Active Directory exploitation, and network penetration testing. I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques in the field, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences through writing and speaking at industry events.

Outside of work, I am an avid Manchester United fan and enjoy following the team and planning to attend matches in person in future. I also enjoy playing football in my free time and staying active through other sports and outdoor activities.
Thank you for stopping by my blog! I hope you find my content interesting and informative. If you have any questions or just want to connect, please feel free to reach out to me.
